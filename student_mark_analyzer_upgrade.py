# Next, you can upgrade your Student Marks Analyzer with small improvements:
# Let the user enter student names and marks instead of hardcoding.
# Store data in a file (marks.txt) and read it back.
# Print a ranking list (all students sorted by average).
# Would you like me to guide you through Step 1: taking input from the user for this project
